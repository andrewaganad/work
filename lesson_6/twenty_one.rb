# Bonus features:
# 1. If you cache each player's totals in local variables once at the top of the
#    main loop, each total will not continue to update correctly when called.
#    Each time the hand is called, you have to update that specific hand,
#    otherwise the original total at the top of the main loop will be used (0).

# 2. The third play_again? method doesn't explicitly use next as a result of it
#    being the last method at the end of the loop. It doesn't need next because
#    the loop will naturally start all over again whereas in the previous two
#    the loop would continue despite busting,
